This is an app to facilitate the management of your healthy goals.

My Meals App goal is to offer a solution to manage the Nutritionists and Patients matters. 
This app will help Nutritionists to personalize Meal Plans and share those with the patients, who will be  
able to check/view their weekly meals in here, making it easier to organize and manage.
